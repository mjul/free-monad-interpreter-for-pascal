# Free Monad Interpreter for a Pascal Subset, in Rust
Writing a free monad interpreter for a tiny subset of Pascal, in Rust.
Let's see where this goes...


# Why Pascal
Pascal is a language from 1970 by Niklaus Wirth. 
It is easy to build a compiler for Pascal, and has been used for teaching compilers extensively,
making grammars and related materials readily available, also for small but useful subsets of Pascal.

This makes it an ideal case, since it moves focus to the free monad interpreter and it applications
instead of consuming a lot of effort to design a bespoke language.
